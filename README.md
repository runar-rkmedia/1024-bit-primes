# 1024 bit primes

This is based on the article [How hard can generating 1024-bit primes really be?](https://glitchcomet.com/articles/1024-bit-primes/)

I found the article fascinating, and have done some work on the initial steps, especially with Gotally.

The article goes well beyond my attempts, and also my current understanding. But each step builds on eachother, 
so my thought is to attempt to follow along with each step, and hopefully I'll learn some of the more advanced topics here.
